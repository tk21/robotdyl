Mac Installation Guide
===========================

Macintosh installation uses the command line, but if you follow the instructions carefully, you should have no problem installing KA Lite.
#. Download and install the latest Python for Mac: https://www.python.org/downloads
#. You need to open the Terminal app. There are many ways to do this. We suggest the following:

	* Press *'Enter'* with the "Terminal" app selected and it should open.
#. In the Terminal, enter *Python -V* and press *'Enter'*. **The version number should reflect the Python version you just installed.**
#. KA Lite uses Git to distribute it's code for non-Windows operating systems.
	* Proceed to Git's website (http://git-scm.com/downloads) to download and install if you don't have it already.
#. Create the folder where you would like to install KA Lite.	
	* In the Terminal, type *cd* and then drag the folder you created into the Terminal.
	* This will copy the path name into the Terminal window.
	* Press *'Enter'*.
#. Now you can copy and paste this command into the terminal and press *'Enter'*.
	* *git clone https://github.com/learningequality/ka-lite.git*
#. Once it finishes downloading, enter *cd ka-lite* to move into the folder that was just downloaded.
