KA Lite Documentation
===================================

Welcome to the KA Lite Documentation! Here, you will find information on how to set up the KA Lite software, how to manage it, and how to perform role-specific tasks. 

KA Lite is lightweight web app that allows users without Internet access to engage with `Khan Academy`_ videos and exercises in completely offline settings, bringing the flipped classroom model to some of the most remote areas in the world. Users can track their progress through videos and exercises, and coaches can log in and check up on their progress to identify which areas the students need the most help in.

>>Side note we should probably have some fat notice on how to download the videos, or at least mention in the guide that * THE VIDEOS WILL NOT COME WITH THE SOFTWARE INITIALLY * ... because users are probably expecting the videos to be there after the set up... but there are none... just saying <<
